# Module-7-Challenge

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a report that shows how many employees will be eligible to retire, in order to determine the size of the 'silver tsunami' as older employees retire in the next several years. In addition, the desired report will also demonstrate which employees are eligible for a mentorship program with retiring employees, to prepare them for the roles they will soon need to fill. Based on the results of this report, we can analyze how best to manage this 'silver tsunami'.

## Results
The major conclusions we can draw from these results are as follows:

-The number of employees eligible for retirement is 72,458

-Senior Engineer is the title most affected by the potential silver tsunami, with Senior Staff a close follow up, at 25,916 and 24,296 respectively, meaning there will be a large void of Senior employees with years of experience and knowledge.

-The number of employees eligible for mentorship is 1,550, and any of the eligible employees make up Senior Staff and Senior Engineers, meaning that many have the experience necessary to perform at the level required.  

-Since the majority of retiring employees are in Senior positions, it also stands to reason that the company has a lot of room for growth as well as proven tracks to rise up the corporate ladder; from this, we can extrapolate that they are likely to have a fair amount of applicants, given that the company would have a reputation as being a good company to work for. We can assume that at least the retiring number of applicants will apply. 

## Summary

Overall, more than 70,000 employees will potentiall be retiring in the near future from Pewlett-Hackard, with a massive majority in the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions. This will of course be a blow to Pewlett Hackard, losing so many experienced employees. 

Staying at the company, and eligible to mentor the incoming crop of Hackard-ites, will be 1,550 employees. A majority of them are Senior Engineers and Staff as well and will have the experience necessary to train the incoming applicants. 
However, they would have large cohorts of mentees- if all 1,550 eligible employees can take on mentorship, that 72,458 opening positions would come out to about 46 per mentor. This workload is not feasible for employees in addition to their other tasks. Further, a number of these eligible employees may have experience, but may be relatively new hires at the company despite their age- so it is reasonable for us to assume that not all 1550 of the eligible employees will be mentoring, only increasing the cohort count per mentor. 
It would be prudent to focus hiring on more experienced employees, to decrease the need for as many mentors. 

To further improve this analysis, it would be useful to also generate tables that included the department number in our analysis, so that we could generate tables grouped by departments and retiring employees, so we could better understand which departments are most affected.
It would also be useful to examine the retiring employees ordered by their time with the company, to determine a 'risk of retirement' factor. Some employees prefer to work after being eligible for retirement, and employees that are newer to a company are less likely to leave after a short period of time. This would help better assess the true number of positions needing to be filled.
